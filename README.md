*Navbar*
 I've used Bootstrap, when scroll down to roughly to #about section, you can see its background become darker, so it has a better contrast for the user to see the Navbar
// Improvement can be made: Popped up overlay of navbar-toggler


*Video Intro*
Animation triggered when you scroll down, it was inspired by Apple's product showcase.

// Improvement can be made: Accurate scrolling trigger


*About*
Just a simple bootstrap row & col arrangement.
Background of the portrait was removed for cleaner visual experience.
// Improvement can be made: Animation of the text can be added to slideleft


*Contact*
backend was using formspree API

*All in all, my very first website, so bear with me if there're bugs or laggy animation. Hope you enjoy my aboutMe page :)
